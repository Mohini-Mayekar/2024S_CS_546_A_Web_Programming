            <h2>Kerala, India</h2>
            <p>Kerala is the most gorgeous state in the eyes of many tourists, with breathtaking scenery that includes
                sunny beaches, lush hills, and shimmering backwaters. The state's most popular attraction is the
                well-known Kerala backwaters, with Alleppey serving as their center. Photographers dream of capturing
                this serene, enchanting network of rivers, lagoons, canals, and waterways lined by palm trees.
                <br>
                A traditional houseboat, formerly used by the people to transport fish, rice, and spices, is the ideal
                way to explore the backwaters; it's now been converted into a "floating hotel." You can eat freshly
                prepared Indian cuisine while observing the passing scenery while spending one or two nights at sea.
